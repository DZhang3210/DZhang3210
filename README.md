👨‍💻 As a Computer Science student at NYU with a targeted graduation date of December 2024, I am immersed in the world of algorithms, system architecture, and full-stack web development. I'm passionate about using my knowledge in React, Node.js, and Raspberry Pi to create software that not only functions efficiently but also prioritizes the user experience.

🏆 My practical skills have been honed through ambitious projects such as a real-time medical pager system designed to streamline healthcare communications and a voice-activated smart mirror that garnered the NYU Nick Russo Award for engineering excellence.

🚀 In my role as an EE/CS Engineer at Rogue Aerospace, I have contributed to the field of aerospace technology by leading the development of onboard electronics for a NASA competition rocket and innovating payload tracking systems that meet rigorous standards.

🎓 Academically, I am maintaining a strong GPA of 3.67 and have furthered my expertise through certifications like AWS Certified Database-Specialty and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

💼 I am now looking to bring my background in developing scalable solutions, my innovative approach to problem-solving, and my ability to collaborate across disciplines to a challenging role in software development.
